# Limes
Limes provides an easy work flow with MFA protected access keys, temporary credentials and access to multiple roles/accounts.

Limes is the Local Instance MEtadata Service and emulates parts of the [AWS Instance Metadata Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) running on Amazon Linux. The AWS SDK and AWS CLI can therefor utilize this service to authenticate.

## Warning
The AWS SDK refreshes credentials automatically when using limes. So **all** services will change profile if the profile is changed in limes.

##  Installation
1. Download binary for your architecture from https://github.com/otm/limes/releases/latest
2. Copy the file to `/usr/local/bin` or appropriate location in PATH
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/limes`
4. **Linux:** Allow limes to bind to privileged ports `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/limes`

**Note:** On Mac OS limes server is needed to run as root for the time being.

## Configuring the Loop Back Device
The configuration below adds the necessary IP configuration on the loop back device. Without this configuration the service can not start.

**Note:** This configuration is not persistent between reboots.

#### Linux
```
sudo ip addr add 169.254.169.254/24 broadcast 169.254.169.255 dev lo:metadata
sudo ip link set dev lo:metadata up
```

#### Mac
```
sudo /sbin/ifconfig lo0 alias 169.254.169.254
```

To get a persistent configuration of Loop Back Device on Mac, checkout [this gist](https://gist.github.com/IanSavchenko/6734cb4ac8422399e60f34d7a68ccd44).

## Bash Completion

##### Linux:
```
wget -O /etc/bash_completion.d/limes https://raw.githubusercontent.com/otm/limes/master/assets/limes
```

##### Mac
```
wget -O $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/limes https://raw.githubusercontent.com/otm/limes/master/assets/limes
```

##### Fixing Completion for AWS CLI
There is currently a bug in the completer for the AWS CLI that makes it misbehave when used with `_command_offset`. This can be solved by adding a secondary completion entry for the AWS CLI. To make this persistent add it to your bash configuration.  

**Linux**
```
complete -C '/usr/local/bin/aws_completer' limes run aws
```

**Mac (Brew)**
```
complete -C "$(brew --prefix)/bin/aws_completer" limes run aws
```

## Configuring IAM (Identity and Access Management)
To be done

## Configuring IMS (Instance Meta-data Service)
There is an [example configuration file](https://github.com/otm/limes/blob/master/config.example). The configuration file is documented. Make a copy of the file and place it in `~/.limes/config`.

```
mkdir -p ~/.limes
wget -O ~/.limes/config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/otm/limes/master/config.example
```

Use your favorite text editor to update ~/.limes/config

## Usage
Running `limes` in your terminal prints usage information.

#### Starting the Service
The service is started with `limes start`.

#### Assuming Profiles
A profile is assumed with `limes assume <profile-name>`, where profile-name is a configured profile. Please note that this does not refer to AWS profiles but profiles configured in limes.

#### Running Applications with Alternate Profile
If you have assumed a role on limes you might want to run an application once with an alternate profile. This is possible without assuming the profile with the `run` subcommand.

```
limes --profile <name> run <application> [args...]
```

**Tip**
With `limes --profile <name> run bash` it is possible to quickly start a shell with exported environment variables that is valid for an hour.

#### Protected Profiles
By adding `protected: true` to your profile it will not be possible to assume that role. It will only be possible to utilize the subcommands `run` and `env`.

#### Service Status
By running `limes status` it is possible to see the current status, and also it can detect common problems and misconfiguration.

## Known Problems
If AWS environment variables, `.aws/credentials` or `.aws/config` are present there is a chance that the limes does not work. This can be checked with `limes status`.

## Security
The service should be configured on the loop back device, and only accessible from the host it is running on.

**Note:** It is important not to run any service that could forwards request on the host running Limes as this would be a security risk. However, this is no difference from the setup on an Amazon Linux instance in AWS. If an attacker could forward requests to 169.254.169.254/24 your credentials could be compromised. Please note that an attacker could utilize a DNS to resolve to this address, so always be aware where you forward requests to.  

## Roadmap
* Windows support (If I get someone to test it)

## Build
To build you need a Go compiler and environment setup. See https://golang.org/ for more information regarding setting up and configuring Go.

```
go get github.com/otm/limes
go build
```

If protobuf definitions are updated `protoc` is needed on the system. Installation instructions are available at https://github.com/google/protobuf. áº„hen protoc is installed run go generate. Currently build with `libprotoc 3.1.0`.

```
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/{proto,protoc-gen-go}
go generate
```
